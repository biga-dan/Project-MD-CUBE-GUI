Introduction
The MD-CUBE GUI Prototype is a project aimed at providing a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for MD-CUBE, a powerful scientific research code built on the principles of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. This GUI offers an intuitive and efficient way for researchers to interact with MD-CUBE, enabling the setup, execution, and analysis of MD simulations with ease.
